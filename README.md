# Arithmetic-Calculation

This code allows calculation of arithmetic expressions read from the file "input.txt".

x = 5 + 2 ;

y = x * 3 + 2;

The given arithmetic expression is translated into postfix form through the stack. Arithmetic operations are in progress. The values of the variables are updated at the end of the arithmetic operation.

Variable names must be single characters.

"input.txt" can not be a new line character in the last line of the file.

a + b = 7; arithmetic operations can not be performed. There should be only one variable to the left of the '=' sign.
